# Object Orientation in JavaScript

“Every application is a collection of code; the code’s arrangement is the
design." - Sandi Metz

## Learning Goals

- Review the meaning of Object Orientation
- Review the benefits of Object Orientation
- Introduce how JavaScript can be written using Object Orientation

## Introduction

So far in JavaScript, we've discussed the "Three Pillars of Web Programming",
**Recognizing JS events**, **Manipulating the DOM**, and **Communicate with the
server**, and we saw how these pillars are incorporated into web applications.

The process we've learned so far has been:

1.  An HTML page renders on the screen
2.  JavaScript is executed when the page loads
3.  In the JavaScript, event listeners are created pointing to 'free-standing'
    functions, listed out in the JavaScript file.

In that process, we have three primary takeaways:

- Some of these functions handle DOM manipulation
- Some functions handle server communication
- Still other functions may serve as 'helper' functions to others

These functions can be invoked in whatever order we set, or from within each
other. This set up works great when just getting off the ground; with a handful
of functions, we can get an interactive website up and running. What happens,
though, when we want to go beyond a small website?

Let's go back and take a look at the first app we discussed, [Simple Liker][simple liker]:

![working example of favoriting a post][three-pillars-example-working]

Imagine we want to add a feature to this - we want to display the number of
users who have liked this message. Let's say we can get this info from the
server, so we write a function that fetches the data and updates the DOM to
display it. This function could be called when the page loads as well as
whenever anyone clicks the 'like' button.

Great, but what happens when we start to expand further? Right now we only have
the one message from Byron. What if we could have multiple messages to like?
More functions would be needed. We'd probably have to modify the code that we
have, as well, making it more complicated.

Continuing to expand our app, what about displaying a list of names of people
who liked this post? More code is needed. How about being able to post our _own_
messages for other users to like? Even more code. What about adding the option
to add message comments? A lot more code.

At this point, our Simple Liker would no longer be simple, and pretty soon, the
code needed to keep all our features working has grown quite long. What's worse,
all of the different things that happen on our website are starting to get
jumbled together in a heap of functions. You may be able to get everything
working for every feature added but the functions have become intertwined and dependent on each other. Coding this way comes at a cost:

**The more complicated our code gets, the harder it is to understand and
change it.**

In larger applications, we might be dealing with hundreds of functions, DOM
elements, and events, all tied together, forming a web of
relationships. It becomes increasingly difficult to follow the flow of actions
in your code as more and more functions are introduced. Changes to one function
may have unforeseen affects on functions _'downstream'_.

This web of dependent, free-standing functions can be improved with
organization. We do things like group functions together, arrange code in a
readable way. Our options, however, are still limited - it's still a big web.

In this and the following lessons, we're going to take a look at an alternative
way to structure our code, Object Orientation. By understanding and using OO, we
can _design_ our code to be easier to read, understand and change.

## Define Object Orientation

With Object Orientation, instead of a web, we can think of our code as a
collection of _cells_. These cells are separated from each other, can contain
_information_, bits of data like variables, as well as _behaviors_, functions
directly related to that data.

Consider the lessons so far: any sort of data we had to store and manipulate
has been either stored in variables or passed to functions as arguments. Code
like this:

```js
let name = 'Evan';
let age = 34;

function sayHello(nameOfPerson) {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${nameOfPerson}.`);
}

function sayAge(age) {
  console.log(`I am ${age} years old.`);
}

function haveBirthday(age) {
  return age + 1;
}

sayHello(name);
// => Hello, my name is Evan.
sayAge(age);
// => I am 34 years old.
age = haveBirthday(age);
sayAge(age);
// => I am 35 years old.
```

Here, we've got some data, a `String` and an `Integer` assigned to variables,
and a few functions for using and reading that data. The functions and data are
closely related. Combined, they convey information about a _person_. While we,
as human beings, might be able to interpret the above code as all related, as
far as code structure, **there isn't anything structurally that actually
_encodes_ those relationships**. The _names_ of our functions
and variables are the only indicators that they are related.

Object Orientation grants us the ability to write code that **structurally**
establishes the relationships between data and functions. If we rewrite our
first code snippet applying Object Orientation, we could write something like
this:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }

  sayAge() {
    console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }

  haveBirthday(age) {
    console.log(`It's my birthday!`);
    this.age += 1;
  }
}

let evan = new Person('Evan', 34);

evan.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Evan.
evan.sayAge();
// => I am 34 years old.
evan.haveBirthday();
// => It's my birthday.
evan.sayAge();
// => I am 35 years old.
evan;
// => Person { name: 'Evan', age: 35 }
```

Do not be alarmed if some of this looks unfamiliar. We will go into greater
detail later about specific syntax. For now, though, take a moment to notice
what changed. Where did our variables go? Now we just have one: `evan`.
Instead of being assigned to a data type like a `String` or an `Integer`,
`evan` assigned to a `Person` object that _contains_ our data.

This `Person` object is a `class`, the fundamental structure underlying all
Object Oriented code in JavaScript. The line:

```js
let evan = new Person('Evan', 34);
```

...initializes a copy, a single **_instance_** of the `Person` `class` (more on
this later). Two arguments are passed in, `'Evan'` and `34`, and the resulting
instance is assigned to a variable.

The instance we just created contains the functions that were previously
free-standing, `sayHello`, `sayAge`, and `haveBirthday`. Notice here that we're
no longer passing data as arguments to these functions when we call them.

> or `class` instance will be referred to as 'methods'.
> The word _'function'_ will be used when referring to functions outside of any `class`
> object.

Instead of receiving arguments, our _methods_ have access to the data as
`this.name` and `this.age`! These are referred to as _properties_, and are
both assigned when a new instance of the `Person` class is created.

With our data and _methods_ captured in the `Person` instance, we've
**_encapsulated_** all the information and behaviors that represent a _person_ in
our code!

## The Benefits of Object Orientation

The end result of our code example hasn't changed - we are still able to perform
the same actions with minor modifications. However, by designing and creating
`class`es like this, we can gain some important benefits:

### Easier to Change

If we want to add more code related to a _person_, instead of just adding it in
to a long list of functions, we now have a clear, logical place
to put it. This makes it easier to extend code, and encourages good organization
in the future.

### Offers Better Data Control

By encapsulating our data in a `class`, we can protect that data from unexpected
changes. When using local variables like `let name = "Evan"`, the variable is
vulnerable to change from any function. Functions, meanwhile, will do what they
are programmed to do, regardless of the data they are given. They are oblivious.

```js
function sayHello(nameOfPerson) {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${nameOfPerson}.`);
}

sayHello([23, 'Golden Apple']);
// => Hello, my name is 23,Golden Apple.
```

In a `class`, however, we can design our code so that methods with a specific
purpose only interact with and change the data they are supposed to. We don't
need a stand alone `sayHello` function that takes in any argument and tries to
log it, we just need it for saying a particular person's name.

```js
let sarah = new Person('Sarah', 31);
sarah.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Sarah.
```

Equally, using a `class` to encapsulate our data allows us to be specific in how
that data is used. The `sarah` variable in the code snippet above points to an
entire _instance_ of the `Person` class. Wherever `sarah` goes, `sarah` will
always carry its properties and methods with it. If we need to access
data stored on the instance, we can get property values directly:

```js
sarah.name;
// => 'Sarah'
```

Or use the built in methods _we've_ defined to access the information however we choose:

```js
sarah.sayAge();
// => I am 31 years old.
```

### Easy to Replicate

Every time we initialize a new instance of the `Person` class, we create a
unique object:

```js
let sarah = new Person('Sarah', 31);
let evan = new Person('Evan', 34);
```

Since each instance of `Person` has unique data, our instance methods will
behave accordingly and only use _their_ data:

```js
evan.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Evan.
sarah.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Sarah.
```

This turns out to be a fantastic help when dealing with many collections of
similar data. For example, comments on a blog post - while
the data is unique to each, comments should always 'behave' the same way - they
all display the same on the page. With Object Orientation, we can write a
`Comment` `class` and create an 'instance' for each unique comment.

Once we establish the data and methods for a `class`, we can create as many
copies as we need.

### Improves Understanding by Adding Meaning

By encapsulating related information and behavior, we have organized our code in
a more meaningful way. It _makes sense_ to us as humans to group related things
like this. Object Orientation works well for representing real world systems
and relationships in code, which makes it easier to comprehend.

```js
let sarah = new Person('Sarah', 31);
let evan = new Person('Evan', 34);
let restaurant = new Restaurant('La Villa', '261 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NY');

evan.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Evan.
sarah.sayHello();
// => Hello, my name is Sarah.

restaurant.addGuest(evan);
restaurant.addGuest(sarah);
restaurant.serveGuest(evan, new Drink('Water'));
restaurant.serveGuest(sarah, new Drink('Water'));

evan.saySmallTalk();
// => How about this weather?
```

All `class`es are structured in a consistent way, so even though we don't
know the details of the `Restaurant` `class`, we can still infer how the
`Restaurant`, `Person` and `Drink` `class`es might interact.

Many systems of inter-related things can be represented as objects interacting
with one another, and being able to visualize these relationships helps when
designing complex applications. Even the more abstract concepts of web
programming can be easier to understand using Object Orientation, though it
takes some practice to think in the OO mindset.

## Conclusion

There is a lot involved in writing Object Oriented code. In the upcoming
lessons, we will build `class`es from scratch and talk about the different ways
we can design them. Later on, we will introduce `class` interactions and how
many instances of different `class`es can work together. Object Orientation
can fundamentally change the way we design our code, but as we explore, we will
see how proper design encourages code that is easier to use, understand, change
and maintain.
